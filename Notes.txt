Definition: "Strings are a data type used to represent text and are wrapped in either a single or double quotes.""A list of characters surrounded by quotes, used to represent text in computer programs.""Strings in JavaScript (as in most programming languages) are just sequences of characters, which can include letters, numbers, punctuation, and spaces. We put strings between quotes so JavaScript knows where they start and end."Example
	* Single quote: var name = 'Joe';
	* Double quote: var name = "Joe";

Best Practice
	* Choose one implementation, either single or double quote, and use consistently.
	* Teams will often have agreed upon style guide.

Error:
	* Single and double quote: var name = 'Joe";
	* Double and single quote: var name = "Joe';

Turn Any Data Type Into a String
	1. typeof 24; // 'number' 
	2. typeof '24'; // 'string'
	3. typeof true; // 'boolean'
	4. typeof 'true'; // 'string'

Single or Double Quotes Within Strings
	* Error

		* 
var greeting = 'It's good to meet you!';Single quote within text wrapped in single quotes.
		* 
var greeting2 = "Tell Jack that I say "Hi"";Double quotes within text wrapped in double quotes.
	* Solution

		* 
var greeting = "It's good to meet you!";Single quote within double quotes.
		* 
var greeting2 = 'Tell Jack that I say "Hi"';Doubles quotes within single quotes.
	* Escape Clause Solution

		* 
var greeting = 'It\'s good to meet you!';Escape clause used before single quote within text wrapped in single quotes.
		* 
var greeting2 = "Tell Jack that I say \"Hi\""; Escape clause used before double quotes within text wrapped in double quotes.

Looking Ahead - Future Lessons
	* Joining Strings
		1. var greeting = "Hi,";
		2. var myName = "Rob";
		3. greeting + " " + myName; // "Hi, Rob"

	* Finding the Length of a String
		1. var neighborGreeting = "Hi, Rob";
		2. neighborGreeting.length; // 7

	* Getting a Single Character from a String
		1. var neighborGreeting = "Hi, Rob";
		2. neighborGreeting[0]; // "H"
		3. neighborGreeting[1]; // "i"

	* Upper Case
		1. var neighborGreeting = "Hi, Rob";
		2. neighborGreeting.toUpperCase(); // "HI, ROB"

	* Lower Case
		1. var neighborGreeting = "Hi, Rob";
		2. neighborGreeting.toLowerCase(); // "hi, rob"

Operators allow programmers to create a single value from one or more values.”Binary Operators:
	* Definition: Requires two operands, one before the operator and one after the operator.
	* Syntax: operand1 operator operand2
	* Example: 2 + 3; or x * z;

Unary Operators:
	* Definition: Requires a single operand, either before or after the operator.
	* Syntax: operator operand OR operand operator
	* Example: y++ OR ++y

Arithmetic Operators: Multiplication, Division, Modulus, Addition and Subtraction
	* Definition: Takes numerical values (either literals or variables) as their operands and returns a single numerical value.
	* Example: var count = 10 + 5 - 4; // 11
	* Example: var mult = 3 * 5; // 15

Modulus Operators
	* Definition: This will give us the remainder of two values.
	* Example: 21 % 4; // 1

Assignment Operators:
	* Definition: Assigns a value to its left operand based on the value of its right operand.
	* Example: var count = 5;

Comparison Operators:
	* Definition: Compare both sides of equation and returns a logical value based on whether the comparison is true. The operands can be numerical, string, logical, or object values.
	* Equality operator (==): Checks for equality in value. Coersion may take place finding equal values between a string and number.
	* Strict equality operator (===): Checks for equality in value and type. Does not leave room for coersion.
	* example: 5 == '5'; // true
	* example: 5 === '5' // false

String Operator:
	* Definition: When the ‘+’ is used on strings the ‘+’ operator is called the concatenation operator.
	* example: 'Hello' + ' ' + 'world'; // 'Hello world' 

ObjectsDot Notationobject literal notationbracket notationDefinition:"An object is a value type consisting of key/value pairs inside curly braces. The keys are also known as properties. Everything in JavaScript that isn’t a primitive is an object.""A set of key-value pairs. Each key is a string that can be paired with any JavaScript value. You can then use the key to retrieve whatever value it's within in the object.""Objects in JavaScript are very similar to arrays, but objects use strings instead of numbers to access the different elements. The strings are called keys or properties, and the elements they point to are called values. Together these pieces of information are called key-value pairs."Vocabulary Change:
	* Variables become known as properties in objects.
	* Functions become known as methods in objects.

Object Literal Notation:
	* Syntax: var object = {};
	* Key/Properties: Single or double quotes not needed for valid variable names. Invalid variable names will require single or double quotes.

		* age = 24;
		* "user age" = 24;

How to Access Properties on an Object: 
	* The two primary ways of accessing properties of an object are with dot notation and bracket notation.
	* Bracket Notation:

		* Syntax: object[‘property’] = value;
		* Example:


             var book = { title: ‘Huck Fin’, pages: 260 };             book[‘title’]; // ‘Huck Fin’             book[’pages’]; // 260
	* Dot Notation:

		*    Syntax: object.property = value;
		*    Example:


               var name = { firtName: ‘John’, lastName: ‘Doe’ };               name.firstName; // ‘John’               name.lastName; // ‘Doe’How to Add Properties and Values on an Object: 
	* You can add items to an object by using strings.
	* Bracket Notation:

		* var person = {};
		* person["name"] = "Rob";
	* Dot Notation: 

		* var person = {};
		* person.name = "Rob";


Basic Array Structure

An array is a type of basic data structure that lets us store and access information, for example a set of string like types of animals. Without arrays we could define a set of strings as variables like this:



var cat1 = "lion";
var cat2 = "tiger";
var cat3 = "leopard";
var cat4 = "tabby";

but a better way to store and access these variables would be in an array.



var cats = ["lion", "tiger", "leopard", "tabby"];

***REMEMBER: Arrays are indexed starting at 0. So the above array would be indexed as so:
Referencing Items in the Array
The basic structure to reference items in the array is this. If I wanted to reference leopard from the above array i would do this:



cats[2]  //leopard


You simply add the [] brackets to the end of the table name and then input the index of the item you would like to call. Roll tide.

Modify Items in the Array
You can modify an item in the array just like you would a variable, you simply reference it and then set it equal to something else. For example if I decide that a tabby is not quite fierce enough for this array, I can simply reference it and then set it equal to something else:



cats[3] = "jaguar";


cats[3]    //jaguar


Add Items to Array
We can add items to the array in the exact same way. To add a 5th cat to the table we can simply reference the 4th index (which does not currently exist) and pass it a string!



cats[4] = "hobbes";


Array Properties
.length
To find out how many items are in an array use the .length property:


cats.length   //5

*note: this will return the total number of items, not the final index number which would be 1 less.

.push
adds an item automatically to the end of the array without having to figure out what the last index is and count it manually.


cats.push("panther");

would go ahead and add panther to the end of the array at index 5.

.pop
this will automatically delete the last item in the array.


cats.pop();     //removes the panther that we just added at index 5

.unshift()
Very similar to .push, except .unshift.will add an item to the front of the array.

.shift()
and .shift will remove an item from the front.

Storing Items in a Variable
One very common thing to do when you are removing items from an array is to store them in another variable. For example:



var firstCat = cats.shift();

//lion



So as you can see here we made an array of cats and the first cat is the lion. Then we created a variable called firstCat and set that equal to the first item of the array which we have essentially pulled out of the cats array and set to its own variable.
